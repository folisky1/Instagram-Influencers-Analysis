6. Relationship between Popularity, Activity, and Engagement: 

	a) We observed a subtle, weak positive relationship (0.06r) between **popularity** (follower count) and **activity** (post frequency). This suggests 
           that frequent posting on Instagram does not necessarily lead to a large following.  

	b) We uncovered a mild, weak positive relationship (0.35r) between **engagement** (likes) and **popularity** (follower count). This finding underscores 
           that a high number of followers does not guarantee extensive engagement. Aspects such as content quality, niche targeting, audience targeting, and 
           timing also wield significant influence.
    
	c) A weak negative relationship (-0.34r) was observed between **engagement** (likes) and **activity** (post frequency). This suggests that frequent 
           posting may lead to lower engagement. Excessive posting might dilute engagement levels, as followers may become overwhelmed with content and engage 
           less. Thus, a holistic approach focusing on content quality, audience preferences, timing, hashtags, and location tags is paramount for sustainable 
           engagement.
